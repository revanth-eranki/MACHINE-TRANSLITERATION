# MACHINE-TRANSLITERATION

## English-to-Hindi Transliteration with GRU and Attention Mechanism

### Overview
This project implements a machine transliteration model to convert English text into Hindi script using a combination of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and an attention mechanism.

### Model Architecture

- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** A type of recurrent neural network that helps in capturing temporal dependencies in sequences.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence while generating the output, improving transliteration accuracy.

### Performance
- **Accuracy:** Achieved 60% accuracy in transliterating English text into Hindi.
